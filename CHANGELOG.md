# üß¨ Patch Note

---

## üîñ Version 0.3.0 (October 2025)

### üî• Breaking Changes
* **Minimum Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.10+ due to modern type hint syntax (union types with `|`)
* **Dependency Management**: Migrated from requirements.txt files to pyproject.toml for unified dependency management

### üÜï New Features
* **Modern Dependency Management**: All dependencies now managed through pyproject.toml with optional dependency groups
  - `pip install -e .[test]` for test dependencies
  - `pip install -e .[dev]` for development dependencies
* **Enhanced CI/CD**: GitHub Actions now tests Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (stable) and 3.13, 3.14 (experimental)
* **Improved Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite with 47/48 tests passing
* **Cohort Class**: Supports merging multiple `PivotTable` sample_metadata, and provides `subset()` and `order()` operations
* **CNV Class**: New `CNV` object for handling GISTIC outputs via `read_gistic()`
* **ASCAT3 Support**: Updated TCGA CNV processing with ASCAT3 compatibility
* **Multi-Omics Stacking Model**: New `OmicsStackingModel` for integrative analysis of multi-omics data
* **Expression Table**: New `ExpressionTable` class with clustering capabilities via `to_cluster_table()`
* **Cancer Cell Fraction Table**: `CancerCellFractionTable` for processing PyClone data
* **PCA/CCA Analysis**: Added PCA_CCA methods for SNV and CNV data analysis
* **Model Plotting**: New `ModelPlot` class for machine learning model visualization
* **SQLite Persistence Support**: Both `Cohort` and `PivotTable` now support `.to_sqlite()` and `.read_sqlite()` for persistent storage
* **PairwiseMatrix Abstract Base**: Shared logic of `CooccurMatrix` and `SimilarityMatrix` refactored into `PairwiseMatrix` base class for extensibility
* **Cytoband File Support**: Added cytoband file handling for genomic visualization

### üîß Refactoring

* **License Format**: Updated license specification to proper TOML format
* **Project Structure**: Modernized package structure following PEP 621 standards
* **CI Configuration**: Streamlined GitHub Actions workflow with proper error handling
* **PivotTable `__getitem__` and `subset()` Refactor**: Rewrote the `subset()` method to delegate its core logic to `__getitem__`, with outer-layer metadata alignment handled explicitly via `reindex()`
* **SimilarityMatrix Refactor**: Merged similarity calculation methods into `compute_similarity()` with improved plot configurability

### üõ† Enhancements

* **Ordering & Grouping Utilities**:
  * `Cohort` adds `order_cohorts()` for custom group sorting
  * `CNV` adds `sort_by_chromosome()` to improve genomic ordering in visualization
* **Enhanced Plot Configurability**: Improved `symmetric`, `fontsize`, and `yticklabel_size` options
* **Advanced Plotting Features**:
  * Enhanced `plot_boxplot_with_annot` with xlabel/ylabel parameters and rotation support
  * Updated `mutation_heatmap` and `numeric_heatmap` with `ytick_fontsize` and `annot_fontsize` parameters
  * SVG and other plot format support improvements
  * Multi-cohort plotting capabilities
* **Font Management**: New `FontManager` class for consistent typography across plots
* **Color Management**: Separate `ColorManager` for advanced colormap handling with method chaining
* **Clustering Functions**: Added comprehensive clustering analysis tools
* **Method Plots**: `MethodsPlot` for creating 3D cohort demonstration plots

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* Fixed path/format bug in `write_SigProfilerMatrixGenerator_format`
* Resolved import dependency issues for proper module loading

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecations

* **Deprecated** `to_pickle()` and `read_pickle()` in favor of SQLite persistence for better long-term compatibility

### üì¶ Miscellaneous

* Added `deploy.sh` script to automate PyPI packaging and publishing
* Added `savefig` and `geneinfo` utility functions
* Updated `README` with instructions and examples

---

## üîñ Version 0.2.2 (April 2025)

### üõ†Ô∏è What's Fixed

* Fixed critical packaging issue where essential modules (`core`, `plot`, `utils`) were not included in the distribution.
* Added missing `__init__.py` files to ensure proper module discovery.
* Included necessary files via `MANIFEST.in` to ensure complete source distribution (`.tar.gz`) and wheel (`.whl`) builds.

### üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install pymaftools==0.2.2
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

If you previously installed v0.2, v0.2.1 we recommend upgrading to this version due to incomplete packaging in earlier releases.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pymaftools
```

---

## üîñ Version 0.2.1 (April 2025)

### What's Changed

* Fixed: broken import issue on `pymaftools.core`
* Improved: packaging structure and updated `setup.py`

---

## üîñ Version 0.2.0 (April 2025)

### üÜï New Features

* **Optimized Categorical Heatmap**
  Implemented an optimized version of the `categorical_heatmap` function that enables 10x faster heatmap rendering.

* **LollipopPlot Class**
  Added a new `LollipopPlot` class for improved visualization.

* **PCA Method**
  Added a dedicated method for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

* **Cosine Similarity Method**
  Introduced a method to compute cosine similarity between datasets.

* **Boxplot for Metadata**
  Added a boxplot visualization for metadata.

* **Custom Color Map (cmap) and Alpha**
  Added support for custom colormap (cmap) and alpha values in visualizations.

---

### üõ† Improvements

* **Readme Updates**
  Updated README files with clearer instructions, feature descriptions, and additional examples.

* **Rename Attributes and Methods**
  Refined naming conventions (e.g., `gene_metadata` to `feature_metadata` and `genes` to `features`).

* **Performance Enhancements**
  Significant improvements to speed, particularly with heatmap rendering and metadata filtering.

* **Method Optimization**
  Optimized several methods, such as the `subset` method using `reindex` and improved `calculate TMB` functionality.

---
